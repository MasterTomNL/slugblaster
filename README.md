# Slugblaster system for FoundryVTT
This is a FoundryVTT system for Slugblaster (https://www.slugblaster.com).
Mikey Hamm is the original creator of Slugblaster.
Please buy the official Slugblaster book if you plan on running this module: https://www.myth.works/pages/slugblaster.

Trust me... the book has soo much more content then I was able to fit into this system module... and you'll need it to properly run the game anyways.

With Mikey's permission I've added a bunch of information from the official Slugblaster book: Playbooks, Rollable tables, devices and more.
